Scala is one of the "X-men" of languages where the beauty comes from merging OOP and Functional paradigms into a single "Scalable Language" (Scala). I was workng on a concurrency application (Actor) that processes hadoop xml config files. The simplicty to process large xml files with a few lines of code was pretty amazing.
