##The New Enterprise Data Center

The Enterprise Data Center is in a state of transformation.

The current Enterprise Data Center blueprint (legacy) generally consists of:

a. Commercial Hardware
b. Commercial Operating Systems
c. VM/Hypervisor Centric (Data Center Virtualization)
d. Vertically Scaling
e. All about HA
f. Transactional and Monolithic Applications

The new Enterprise Data Center blueprint:

a. Commercial or Open Hardware (OCP)
b. Open Source Software
c. Elastic Infrastructure - IaaS, PaaS
d. Horizontally Scaling
e. Failure is part of life (Distributed Systems)
f. Distributed Apps or Services Thinking (not VMs)

It would be difficult to execute a 100% replace or rewrite or migration strategy. The best alternative would be stop thinking about cost and think more
about agility. This would require raising a parallel infrastructure connected to the 'legacy' infrastructure built around Services with the ability to
leverage Public Cloud Services. The reality is, not all applications can be migrated to be run as Services. A certain percentage will still need to be run
on perhaps a smaller footprint of the legacy infrastructure as the part of the transformation to to the new "trinity" Data Center Architecture - Legacy, New and Public Cloud
Services.
